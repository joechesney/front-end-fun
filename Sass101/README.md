Run `sass --watch sass:stylesheets` to watch for changes in the sass folder and
compile all files in there to css and add it to the stylesheets folder.

There is a lot more to be done to this to make it look less hideous. Try your
hand at Sass-ifying it! Some ideas:

* Style the footer and put all of its styles in one partial
* Define an extend that will style each of the `block-` classes the same way
* Add more nested styles to the `card-wrapper` class
